Our project will assist Stuyvesant administrators in creating faculty schedules. It will help them optimally schedule classes to teach, preferred lunch periods or courses, etc. by taking the preferences of staff members via a form and our app will display the accumulated data, allowing administrators to create optimal schedules.
