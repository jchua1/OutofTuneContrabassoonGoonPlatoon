A flask driven app that will allow faculty to submit their scheduling preferences online. Administrators will have access to the accumulated responses and will be able to sort them in various ways, allowing easier scheduling and having all teacher preferences readily available in one place. We would also like to make graphs that allows administrators to see at a glance what periods or classes are most requested.
